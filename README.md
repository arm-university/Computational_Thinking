## Resource Aim
To improve the learner’s ability to think computationally. This resource is designed to prepare learners to answer computational questions in the form and complexity that would be expected for GCSE Computer Science examinations.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learners will be more confident in applying the fundamental computational techniques to understand, analyse and solve problems
- Learners will be practised in answering exam-style questions on computational problems

## Resource Structure
These resources consist of a set of code problems with associated questions in the exam style of GCSE Computer Science. These resources can be used in many ways but are best used as part of a discussion exercise with a class. Learners analyse and evaluate the code, then step through the code before answering the exam-style questions.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.

Contact us at school@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
