These resources cover all the GCSE Computer Science Computational Thinking techniques and contain lots of interactive activities to reinforce understanding to prepare learners for their exams.

## Resource Aim
To improve the learnerâ€™s ability to think computationally. This resource is designed to prepare learners to answer computational questions in the form and complexity that would be expected for GCSE Computer Science examinations.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learners will be more confident in applying the fundamental computational techniques to understand, analyse and solve problems
- Learners will be practised in answering exam-style questions on computational problems

## Resource Structure
These resources consist of a set of code problems with associated questions in the exam style of GCSE Computer Science. These resources can be used in many ways but are best used as part of a discussion exercise with a class. Learners analyse and evaluate the code, then step through the code before answering the exam-style questions.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.

Contact us at school@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
